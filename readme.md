# 🌍 Global Energy Evolution – Data Analytics Project

This project analyzes global power generation trends and renewable energy adoption using real-world datasets. It visualizes historical data, highlights top-performing countries, and compares continental energy consumption.

---

## 📦 Datasets Used

- `renewablePowerGeneration97-17.csv`: Year-wise data for Hydro, Solar, Biofuel, and Geothermal energy generation (1990–2017)
- `nonRenewablesTotalPowerGeneration.csv`: Total generation by Coal, Oil, Gas, etc.
- `top20CountriesPowerGeneration.csv`: Power generation stats for top 20 countries
- `Continent_Consumption_TWH.csv`: Energy consumption by continent over time
- `Country_Consumption_TWH.csv`: Country-level consumption data

---

## 📊 Visualizations Generated

- `renewable_energy_trend.png`: Growth of renewable sources over 3 decades
- `top20_renewable_share.png`: Renewable share (%) in total generation for top countries
- `continent_consumption_heatmap.png`: Heatmap of energy consumption by continent and year
